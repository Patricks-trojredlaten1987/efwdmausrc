Oh man, just saw Gladiator II. Can barely piece it together – the theater was a madhouse, popcorn stuck to my hoodie like it's part of the fabric now. My back’s still cramped from that lumpy seat. Maximus uh, sorry, his name’s not Maximus this time, but he’s like... reincarnated or reborn or something, but he’s all grit and bloodlust, just like before. You know me, I love that slow build-up – or was it only like 10 minutes? Time was weird in there.

> There’s a scene with elephants, no wait, horses? Yeah, horses charging, like a mixed-up smoothie of fury. Totally wild. The war drums were pounding my eardrums like they had personal vendetta. And those costumes! Like a history teacher and a fashion designer collided in a car crash. Gorgeous chaos!

I remember the smell. Native spices? Arabian... Italian? Ha, I dunno, but the battles were colossal, with dust swirling like my washing machine on laundry day. There was one solid twist that zinged my brain, but I can’t spoil it here, just you wait. Got half a mind to download the movie when it’s online, somehow it left a crummy trail in my brain I wanna sweep up. 

Random thought: the antagonist could wrestle a bear and come out smelling like victory and sweat. Or maybe that's just the popcorn talking. It'd be worth a second watch, you gotta see it in the big, big screen before whispers turn into spoilers.

Someone in the aisle said they’d heard a rumor — wait where am I going with this... right, the detail! Every spear, arrow, everything felt like it flew past my face. And then the queen, she’s a lion like Cleopatra dressed in stolen time. Kind of like my neighbor’s cat when it walks like royalty, making us all look like peasants.

Oh yeah, remember to watch the movie sooner rather than later. Seriously. Or was that a whisper from the stranger beside me?
